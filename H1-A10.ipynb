    "# Hackathon: From Raw Data to ML-Ready Dataset\n",
    "## Insight-Driven EDA and End-to-End Feature Engineering on Airbnb Data Using pandas and Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Hackathon?\n",
    "\n",
    "A hackathon is a fast-paced, collaborative event where participants use data and technology to solve a real problem end-to-end.  \n",
    "In this hackathon, you will work with a **real-world Airbnb dataset** and complete two interconnected goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Produce a **high-quality exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using `pandas` and `plotly`, extracting meaningful insights, trends, and signals from the data.  \n",
    "- Design and deliver a **clean, feature-rich, ML-ready dataset** that will serve as the foundation for a follow-up hackathon focused on building and evaluating machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to **get the most out of the data**: uncover structure and patterns through EDA, and engineer informative features (numerical, categorical, temporal, textual (TF–IDF), and optionally image-based) to maximize the predictive power of the final dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "<b>About the Dataset</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Context</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes from <a href=\"https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/\">Inside Airbnb</a>, an open project that publishes detailed, regularly updated datasets for cities around the world.  \n",
    "Each city provides three main CSV files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>listings.csv</b> — property characteristics, host profiles, descriptions, amenities, etc.  \n",
    "- <b>calendar.csv</b> — daily availability and pricing information for each listing.  \n",
    "- <b>reviews.csv</b> — guest feedback and textual reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets offer a rich view of the short-term rental market, including availability patterns, pricing behavior, host attributes, and guest sentiment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Inspiration</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Your ultimate objective is to create a dataset suitable for training a machine learning model that predicts whether a specific Airbnb listing will be <b>available on a given date</b>, using property attributes, review information, and host characteristics.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Task</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using one city of your choice from Inside Airbnb, create an end-to-end pipeline that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loads and explores the raw data (EDA).  \n",
    "2. Engineers features (numerical, categorical, temporal, textual TF–IDF, etc.).  \n",
    "3. Builds a unified ML-ready dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Please remember to add comments explaining your decisions. Comments help us understand your thought process and ensure accurate evaluation of your work. This assignment requires code-based solutions—**manually calculated or hard-coded results will not be accepted**. Thoughtful comments and visualizations are encouraged and will be highly valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write your solution directly in this notebook, modifying it as needed.\n",
    "- Once completed, submit the notebook in **.ipynb** format via Moodle.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>Collaboration Requirement: Git & GitHub</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "You must collaborate with your team using a **shared GitHub repository**.  \n",
    "Your use of Git is part of the evaluation. We will specifically look at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Commit quality (clear messages, meaningful steps).  \n",
    "- Balanced participation across team members.  \n",
    "- Use of branches.  \n",
    "- Ability to resolve merge conflicts appropriately.  \n",
    "- A clean, readable project history that reflects real collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good Git practice is **part of your grade**, not optional.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hints</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text columns often carry substantial predictive power, use text-vectorization methods to extract meaningful features.  \n",
    "- Make sure all columns use appropriate data types (categorical, numeric, datetime, boolean). Correct dtypes help prevent subtle bugs and improve performance.  \n",
    "- Feel free to enrich the dataset with any additional information you consider useful: engineered features, external data, derived temporal features, etc.  \n",
    "- If the dataset is too large for your computer, use <code>.sample()</code> to work with a subset while preserving the logic of your pipeline.  \n",
    "- Plotly offers a wide variety of powerful visualizations, experiment creatively, but always begin with a clear analytical question: *What insight am I trying to uncover with this plot?*\n",

    "• Rename merge generated columns such as `date_x` and `date_y` to clearer names like `calendar_date` and `review_date`. This avoids confusion later when we build features based on dates or nights.  \n",

    "• Convert identifier columns (`listing_id`, `host_id`, `reviewer_id`, review `id`) to string. These are keys and should not be treated as numeric predictors in Hackathon 2, so converting them prevents them from being mistakenly used as continuous features.  \n",
    "• Convert stable low cardinality text columns such as `room_type`, `neighbourhood_cleansed` or `instant_bookable` to categorical type. This makes their role as categories explicit and prepares them for simple encodings like one hot encoding in the next hackathon.\n",

    "The merged dataset shows extremely high missingness for most listing and review attributes (95 to 100 percent). This is expected because the calendar, listings and reviews datasets were sampled independently, so only a small number of rows correspond to the same listing. As a result, most listing and review-level features do not align with the calendar rows and cannot be used reliably for analysis or machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure we retain only stable and meaningful variables, we apply the following cleaning strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "• Drop all columns with 95 percent or more missing values. These variables do not provide consistent information and would add noise to the feature matrix.  \n",
    "• Keep structural calendar features (`calendar_date`, `available`, `minimum_nights_calendar`, `maximum_nights_calendar`) because they contain complete information.  \n",
    "• Avoid imputing listing-level or review-level fields because imputing 95 percent missingness would produce artificially filled data that introduces bias and breaks the real structure of the dataset.\n",
