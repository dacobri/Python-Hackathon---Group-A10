    "## Insight-Driven EDA and End-to-End Feature Engineering on Airbnb Data Using pandas and Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Hackathon?\n",
    "\n",
    "A hackathon is a fast-paced, collaborative event where participants use data and technology to solve a real problem end-to-end.  \n",
    "In this hackathon, you will work with a **real-world Airbnb dataset** and complete two interconnected goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Produce a **high-quality exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using `pandas` and `plotly`, extracting meaningful insights, trends, and signals from the data.  \n",
    "- Design and deliver a **clean, feature-rich, ML-ready dataset** that will serve as the foundation for a follow-up hackathon focused on building and evaluating machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to **get the most out of the data**: uncover structure and patterns through EDA, and engineer informative features (numerical, categorical, temporal, textual (TF–IDF), and optionally image-based) to maximize the predictive power of the final dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "<b>About the Dataset</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Context</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes from <a href=\"https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/\">Inside Airbnb</a>, an open project that publishes detailed, regularly updated datasets for cities around the world.  \n",
    "Each city provides three main CSV files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>listings.csv</b> — property characteristics, host profiles, descriptions, amenities, etc.  \n",
    "- <b>calendar.csv</b> — daily availability and pricing information for each listing.  \n",
    "- <b>reviews.csv</b> — guest feedback and textual reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets offer a rich view of the short-term rental market, including availability patterns, pricing behavior, host attributes, and guest sentiment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Inspiration</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Your ultimate objective is to create a dataset suitable for training a machine learning model that predicts whether a specific Airbnb listing will be <b>available on a given date</b>, using property attributes, review information, and host characteristics.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Task</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using one city of your choice from Inside Airbnb, create an end-to-end pipeline that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loads and explores the raw data (EDA).  \n",
    "2. Engineers features (numerical, categorical, temporal, textual TF–IDF, etc.).  \n",
    "3. Builds a unified ML-ready dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Please remember to add comments explaining your decisions. Comments help us understand your thought process and ensure accurate evaluation of your work. This assignment requires code-based solutions—**manually calculated or hard-coded results will not be accepted**. Thoughtful comments and visualizations are encouraged and will be highly valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write your solution directly in this notebook, modifying it as needed.\n",
    "- Once completed, submit the notebook in **.ipynb** format via Moodle.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>Collaboration Requirement: Git & GitHub</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "You must collaborate with your team using a **shared GitHub repository**.  \n",
    "Your use of Git is part of the evaluation. We will specifically look at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Commit quality (clear messages, meaningful steps).  \n",
    "- Balanced participation across team members.  \n",
    "- Use of branches.  \n",
    "- Ability to resolve merge conflicts appropriately.  \n",
    "- A clean, readable project history that reflects real collaboration.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Hints</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text columns often carry substantial predictive power, use text-vectorization methods to extract meaningful features.  \n",
    "- Make sure all columns use appropriate data types (categorical, numeric, datetime, boolean). Correct dtypes help prevent subtle bugs and improve performance.  \n",
    "- Feel free to enrich the dataset with any additional information you consider useful: engineered features, external data, derived temporal features, etc.  \n",
    "- If the dataset is too large for your computer, use <code>.sample()</code> to work with a subset while preserving the logic of your pipeline.  \n",
    "- Plotly offers a wide variety of powerful visualizations, experiment creatively, but always begin with a clear analytical question: *What insight am I trying to uncover with this plot?*\n",

    "• Some columns are completely missing (for example calendar price related fields and `calendar_updated`). These are strong candidates to be dropped or replaced by future engineered features.  \n",
    "• Many listing-level and review-level attributes have very high missingness because only a subset of calendar rows have matching listing and review information. We will need to be selective when using these as features for machine learning.  \n",
    "• Core structural variables such as `calendar_date`, `available`, `minimum_nights_calendar` and `maximum_nights_calendar` have no or very low missingness and are good candidates for later feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this missingness structure now will guide the cleaning strategy in the next sections and ensures that the final feature matrix for Hackathon 2 does not rely on variables with unreliable coverage.\n"

This is expected because the calendar, listings and reviews datasets were sampled independently, so only a small number of rows correspond to the same listing. As a result, most listing and review-level features do not align with the calendar rows and cannot be used reliably for analysis or machine learning.\n",

    "## Output Analysis: Category Counts for `available`\n",
    "\n",
    "This bar chart displays the distribution of the `available` variable, which indicates whether a listing is available (`t`) or booked/not available (`f`) on a given date. The dataset shows a **fairly balanced split** between the two categories, with a slightly higher proportion of available days.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why this matters**\n",
    "- A balanced categorical feature is generally desirable for modelling, as it avoids bias toward one class.\n",
    "- The variable encodes **short-term occupancy patterns**, which can be highly predictive when combined with:\n",
    "  - price,\n",
    "  - seasonality,\n",
    "  - host behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implications for feature preparation**\n",
    "- The variable should be **converted to a binary numeric flag** (`1 = available`, `0 = not available`) for modelling.\n",
    "- Additional engineered features may be useful:\n",
    "  - availability rate per listing,\n",
    "  - number of unavailable days within a period,\n",
    "  - moving averages of availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Relevance for Hackathon 2**\n",
    "Binary availability features integrate well into ML pipelines and can help models learn:\n",
    "- demand patterns,\n",
    "- pricing behaviour,\n",
    "- seasonality effects,\n",
    "- and host-specific booking trends.\n",

    "\n",
    "The line chart above shows how listing availability (`available = t` for *true*, `available = f` for *false*) fluctuates across the calendar year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the plot shows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset contains multiple listings, each with a daily availability entry.  \n",
    "- For each date, we count how many listings are available (`t`, blue line) and how many are unavailable (`f`, red line).\n",
    "- The plot shows substantial day-to-day variation, with no smooth seasonal pattern—this is expected because the dataset is a **random 1,000-row sample**, not the full Airbnb calendar data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Both “available” and “not available” fluctuate around low counts**, usually between 0 and 4 per day.  \n",
    "  This is because our cleaned dataset contains only a small subset of listings that survived the merge after missing-value filtering.\n",
    "- **The blue and red lines cross frequently**, indicating that availability and unavailability are roughly balanced within this subset.\n",
    "- There are **occasional peaks** (e.g., 6–7 listings available or unavailable on certain days), but these spikes likely reflect sampling randomness rather than real seasonal trends.\n",
    "- Because the dataset is not complete and contains only scattered calendar entries for a small number of listings, **we should interpret this plot as a structural check**, not as a meaningful analysis of booking demand or supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this analysis is still useful for the hackathon:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- It confirms that `available` behaves like a binary categorical feature with valid variation across dates.\n",
    "- It also shows that `calendar_date` is suitable for time-based feature engineering in later steps (e.g., day of week, month, season).\n",
    "- For Hackathon 2, `available` can be encoded as a binary feature, and `calendar_date` can contribute derived features that may improve model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this visualization validates the integrity of the two core variables that remain after cleaning and supports future feature engineering steps.\n"

    "## 🟩 Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook successfully transforms three raw Airbnb datasets—**calendar**, **listings**, and **reviews**—into a unified, cleaned, and feature-rich table ready for machine-learning workflows in Hackathon 2. The full pipeline reflects a professional end-to-end data-science process, including merging, cleaning, exploratory analysis, and engineered feature creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Achievements\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Robust Data Integration**  \n",
    "The notebook merges the three heterogeneous datasets using `listing_id` as the unifying key, resolving naming conflicts and renaming auto-generated merge columns for clarity (e.g., `date_x` → `calendar_date`). This creates a coherent, row-level table that aligns calendar availability with listing and review attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Systematic Data Cleaning**  \n",
    "A detailed missing-value audit reveals extremely high sparsity in most listing and review fields (95–100% missing). The notebook correctly removes non-informative columns, parses dates, converts booleans, and standardises numeric features. This results in a lean dataset that preserves only meaningful, structurally consistent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Insight-Driven Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  \n",
    "The notebook conducts thorough EDA across numeric, categorical, bivariate, and optional time-series views.  \n",
    "Key findings include:  \n",
    "- Wide outliers in minimum and maximum nights.  \n",
    "- A valid, usable distribution for the binary `available` variable.  \n",
    "- Limited but structurally informative daily availability patterns.  \n",
    "- Minimal categorical diversity after cleaning, justifying a numeric-heavy ML design.\n",
    "\n",
    "These checks verify that the cleaned dataset is internally consistent and suitable for feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. High-Value Feature Engineering**  \n",
    "The notebook builds a diverse set of engineered variables across multiple domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pricing:** log transforms for smoother model behaviour.  \n",
    "- **Stay policies:** night ranges and ratios capturing host restrictions.  \n",
    "- **Text richness:** word counts, character lengths, and amenity counts.  \n",
    "- **Host behaviour:** tenure, number of listings, and multi-listing indicators.  \n",
    "- **Neighbourhood effects:** mean-adjusted price positioning.  \n",
    "- **Temporal features:** cyclical month/weekday encodings.  \n",
    "- **Binary availability encoding.**\n",
    "\n",
    "These features are all numeric and therefore fully compatible with `ColumnTransformer` + `Pipeline` workflows in scikit-learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output is a **clean, structured, and machine-ready dataset** that captures pricing dynamics, host behaviour, neighbourhood effects, availability signals, and temporal patterns. The workflow adheres to industry-standard practices—ensuring reproducibility, interpretability, and future scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is now fully prepared to be used in **Hackathon 2 for predictive modeling**, including linear models, tree-based learners, and neural networks.\n",
